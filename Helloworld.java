// Jshell - it is a tool for executing java programs. It was introduced in java version 9.
// just open command prompt and type jshell (assuming JDK(java development kit) is already install).
// now you can write code (ex. System.out.print("hello world") , the double quote and sting in it is called as string literal - means words in double qoute.)
// and to end Jshell just type exit and enter , you can also use previous line code by up arrow ,downarrow for descendent line of code.  
// now I am using visual studios so i will write  a hello world program in vs.
