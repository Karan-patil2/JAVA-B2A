//In this challenge, your task is to write a method with the name sumDigits that has a single parameter named number, of type int, and it should return an int.
//The method should only take a number that is a positive number.
//If a negative number is passed, it should return -1, meaning, an invalid value was passed.
//The method should parse out each digit from the number and sum the digits up.
//So, if 125 is the value passed to the method, the code should sum each digit, in this case, 1 + 2 + 5, and return 8, as a value.
//And another example, if the value is 1000, the code should sum each digit, 1 + 0 + 0 + 0, and return 1 as a value.
//If the number is a single digit number, simply return the number itself as the result.

//At the start of the process:
//    number = 1234, and our variable, sum = 0.
//If we use the remainder operator, getting the remainder of the number divided by 10, this will give us the rightmost digit in the number:
//    1234 % 10 = 4
//And 4 is the last digit, or rightmost digit.

//Since we'll be working through the digits from right to left, we'll add this to sum:
//    sum = 4
//Next, we want to drop that rightmost digit, 4, and just have the remaining 3 digits to process.
//We can do this by dividing by 10:
//    1234 / 10 = 123

//So in the second iteration of the loop:
//     number = 123, and sum = 4
//And again we use the remainder operator, getting the remainder of the number divided by 10, which gives us the rightmost digit:
//     123 % 10 = 3
//And we'll add 3 to sum, which was 4:
//      sum = 7
//And now we divide 123 by 10:
//      123 / 10 = 12

//So in the third iteration of the loop:
//     number = 12, and sum = 7
//And we again take number mod 10:
//     12 % 10 = 2
//and 2 gets added to sum:
//      sum = 9
//And we again divide now by 10:
//      12 / 10 = 1
//Now, our number is a single digit, (number < 10), and here we'll break out of the loop.

//So, in this final step, after we've broken out of the loop:
//    number = 1, and sum = 9.
//Now, I can just add this last single digit to sum, and I'll have a final sum of 10.
