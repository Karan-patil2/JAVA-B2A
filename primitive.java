//Primitive data types - int , float , double , decimal , boolean , char.
//Wrapper class - basically these are the primitive data class but in full form (ex. int is a primitive data type and it's wrapper class is Integer that's the difference).

//this code is basic code through which we understand the primitive data types and their range using variable

//Output
//INTEGER RANGE IS = 2147483647 to -2147483648
